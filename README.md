### About the project

This analysis was part of a business case during "Data Analytics Bootcamp" at Spiced Academy.

#### Data

We received a list of 100 csv-files for 100 different categories, each containing the same columns:
● category name - name of the category
● month – number of the month
● year – year
● clicks - page views of the category

#### Tasks

Create an analysis to help the content team and answer following questions:

1. Is there a seasonal pattern for all categories?
2. What are common patterns that we observe within the categories?
3. Are there categories with a similar fingerprint?
4. Now that you know the seasonal pattern, what next actions would you recommend for the
company?
5. Create a presentation to show what you did. Make your results accessible for a broad
audience so that they can use it.
